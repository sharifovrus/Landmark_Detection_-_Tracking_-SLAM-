# Landmark_Detection_and_Tracking_SLAM
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) implementation for a 2 dimensional world. 

A combination of a robot sensor measurements and movement allows to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. 

SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.

Project Instructions:

The project is broken up into three Python notebooks.

Notebook 1 : Robot Moving and Sensing - Define a world and a robot, Visualizing the World, Movement, Landmarks, Sense function

Notebook 2 : Omega and Xi, Constraints

Notebook 3 : Landmark Detection and Tracking - Implement Graph SLAM
